# Frost's RPG Classes v2

A Minecraft NeoForge mod for 1.21 that adds RPG-style classes with abilities and custom stats.

## Design Philosophy

- **Quality over Quantity** - Fewer, more polished classes
- **Natural Complexity** - Gameplay depth from cooldown management, movement, and positioning rather than artificial resource systems
- **Custom Stats System** - Percent-based buffs/debuffs without relying on potion effects
- **Consistent Visuals** - Each class has a cohesive color palette using dust particles and similar effects

## Core Systems

- Player Stats (damage, defense, speed, etc. with percent modifiers)
- Health and Mana Bar Overlays
- Ability Cooldown Management
- Networking for client-server sync

## Building

This mod uses Gradle with ModDevGradle. To build:

```bash
./gradlew build
```
